This project required an intensive data cleaning process. The client expected the data to be such cleaned that in future any analysis could be performed on it easily and effectively. For this purpose I used my extensive data cleaning checklist.  The changes made includes: 1.  Standardizing Data: Sale Date was converted from Date Time format to Date format 2. NULLS in property Address were populated with the correct input using advance Self-Joins 3. Breaking Property and Owner Addresses fields into Address, City and State columns for easier analysis  4. Standardized 'Yes, No, Y and N' inputs in 'Sold as Vacant' column to only 'Yes' and 'No' 5. Removed Duplicates  At the end of this ETL and Data wrangling process the client got extremely neat and 'ready to be analyzed' or 'stored for future use' data
